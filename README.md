# WinSearchAppCache

While working through an interview process, I came across the old "Microsoft.Windows.Cortana" artifacts and wondered what they would look like on my personal computer that had never configured or given permissions to Cortana. 

Here is where I'll put my notes and script so far. This is *ongoing research*. 

C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.Search_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\DeviceSearchCache\AppCache[##################].txt 

The 18 numbers at the end of the filename is the Windows filetime stamp of the iteration of AppCache. It appears that it may write every hour. 
The file is in JSON format. It appears that the "Type:" is 5 if the "Value:" is an integer and 12 if it is a string.

|Headers|Sample|Hypothesis|
|---|---|---|
|System.FileExtension|{'Value': '.exe', 'Type': 12}|The file extension for the indexed file.|
|System.Software.ProductVersion|{'Value': '1.0.4.0', 'Type': 12}|If available, the product version for the application.|
|System.Kind|{'Value': 'program', 'Type': 12}|Program, document, link, and unknown are the options.|	
|System.ParsingName|{'Value': 'Chrome', 'Type': 12}|Anything from app name, to full path, to an AutoGenerated GUID|
|System.Software.TimesUsed|{'Value': 221, 'Type': 5}|Does not match other artifacts|
|System.Tile.Background|{'Value': 4280291898, 'Type': 5}|Unsure, may be whether the app also runs in the background?|
|System.AppUserModel.PackageFullName|{'Value': 'Microsoft.BingWeather_4.53.41681.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe', 'Type': 12}|Full name|
|System.Identity|{'Value': 'Microsoft.BingWeather_8wekyb3d8bbwe', 'Type': 12}|Short name|
|System.FileName|{'Value': 'vmware', 'Type': 12}|Actual filename without extension|
|System.ConnectedSearch.JumpList|List of values, in Screenshot|Contains jumplists for some items that don't have jumplists in the normal location|
|System.ConnectedSearch. VoiceCommandExamples|Unknown|Not sure yet, all my rows were blank.|
|System.ItemType|Trusted Immersive|Options on my machine are "Trusted Immersive", "Immersive", or "Desktop"|
|System.DateAccessed|133022364739230000|Date of access in Windows Filetime - not last access for all|
|System.Tile.EncodedTargetPath|C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\pythonw.exe|May be full file path or same as ParsingName|		
|System.Tile.SmallLogoPath|images\logo.png|Mostly Windows services have this, looks like part of path to the logo/icon image|
|System.ItemNameDisplay|GitHub Desktop|Basic application display name.

If ParsingName starts with "6D809377-6AF0-444B-8957-A3773F02200E" or "7C5A40EF-A0FB-4BFC-874A-C0F2E0B9FA8E" that seems to refer to the folder "\Program Files (x86)\". Confirmed by both registry folder values (HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderDescriptions) and looking at the full path of the executable. If it starts with "1AC14E77-02E7-4E5D-B744-2EB1AE5198B7" or "D65231B0-B2F1-4857-A4CE-A8E7C6EA7D27" that seems to refer to System32 or SysWOW64. Last, if it starts with "F38BF404-1D43-42F2-9305-67DE0B28FC23", it is located in the C:\Windows folder.  
It appears that "Tile.Background" has a common value of 16777215 on my machine for most applications and then some Windows applications have other larger values.

I will be continuing to work on this as time allows.
